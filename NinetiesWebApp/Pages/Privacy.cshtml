    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> Like, sometime after Y2K didn’t ruin everything</p>

    <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Your Data</h2>
    <p>We might collect your username, your fave boy band, and whether you think Tamagotchis deserved better. We pinky promise not to sell it… unless someone offers a LOT of Beanie Babies.</p>

    <h2>🍪 Cookies (Not the edible kind, sorry)</h2>
    <p>Yes, we use cookies. No, you can’t eat them. They just help us remember you, like “coolskater99,” so you don’t have to log in again on your family’s shared Windows 95 machine.</p>

    <h2>💾 Chat Logs</h2>
    <p>We *might* keep logs of the chat. Not to be creepy—just to settle arguments about whether the <em>Red Ranger</em> was cooler than the <em>Green Ranger</em>.</p>

    <h2>👾 Sharing Your Info</h2>
    <p>We don’t share your info. Ever. Unless aliens abduct us and demand your ICQ number. Even then—we'll try to resist.</p>

    <h2>🛡️ Security</h2>
    <p>We use cutting-edge security like “password123” and Clippy. (“It looks like you’re trying to stay safe online. Want help?”)</p>

    <h2>📺 Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>If you don’t know what a floppy disk is, ask a grown-up before proceeding.</p>

    <h2>🌀 Updates</h2>
    <p>This page gets updated whenever we remember or when someone reminds us on AOL. Whichever comes first.</p>

    <h2>📬 Contact</h2>
    <p>Want to complain, ask a question, or trade Pokémon cards? Email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mychatroom.biz">privacy@mychatroom.biz</a>. We check it like once a week, tops.</p>
